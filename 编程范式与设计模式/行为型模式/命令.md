# 命令

命令是一种行为设计模式，它可将请求转换为一个包含与请求相关的所有信息的独立对象。该转换让你能根据不同的请求将方法参数化、延迟请求执行或将其放入队列中，且能实现可撤销操作。

# 案例：编辑器

```ts
// The base command class defines the common interface for all
// concrete commands.
abstract class Command is
    protected field app: Application
    protected field editor: Editor
    protected field backup: text

    constructor Command(app: Application, editor: Editor) is
        this.app = app
        this.editor = editor

    // Make a backup of the editor's state.
    method saveBackup() is
        backup = editor.text

    // Restore the editor's state.
    method undo() is
        editor.text = backup

    // The execution method is declared abstract to force all
    // concrete commands to provide their own implementations.
    // The method must return true or false depending on whether
    // the command changes the editor's state.
    abstract method execute()


// The concrete commands go here.
class CopyCommand extends Command is
    // The copy command isn't saved to the history since it
    // doesn't change the editor's state.
    method execute() is
        app.clipboard = editor.getSelection()
        return false

class CutCommand extends Command is
    // The cut command does change the editor's state, therefore
    // it must be saved to the history. And it'll be saved as
    // long as the method returns true.
    method execute() is
        saveBackup()
        app.clipboard = editor.getSelection()
        editor.deleteSelection()
        return true

class PasteCommand extends Command is
    method execute() is
        saveBackup()
        editor.replaceSelection(app.clipboard)
        return true

// The undo operation is also a command.
class UndoCommand extends Command is
    method execute() is
        app.undo()
        return false


// The global command history is just a stack.
class CommandHistory is
    private field history: array of Command

    // Last in...
    method push(c: Command) is
        // Push the command to the end of the history array.

    // ...first out
    method pop():Command is
        // Get the most recent command from the history.


// The editor class has actual text editing operations. It plays
// the role of a receiver: all commands end up delegating
// execution to the editor's methods.
class Editor is
    field text: string

    method getSelection() is
        // Return selected text.

    method deleteSelection() is
        // Delete selected text.

    method replaceSelection(text) is
        // Insert the clipboard's contents at the current
        // position.


// The application class sets up object relations. It acts as a
// sender: when something needs to be done, it creates a command
// object and executes it.
class Application is
    field clipboard: string
    field editors: array of Editors
    field activeEditor: Editor
    field history: CommandHistory

    // The code which assigns commands to UI objects may look
    // like this.
    method createUI() is
        // ...
        copy = function() { executeCommand(
            new CopyCommand(this, activeEditor)) }
        copyButton.setCommand(copy)
        shortcuts.onKeyPress("Ctrl+C", copy)

        cut = function() { executeCommand(
            new CutCommand(this, activeEditor)) }
        cutButton.setCommand(cut)
        shortcuts.onKeyPress("Ctrl+X", cut)

        paste = function() { executeCommand(
            new PasteCommand(this, activeEditor)) }
        pasteButton.setCommand(paste)
        shortcuts.onKeyPress("Ctrl+V", paste)

        undo = function() { executeCommand(
            new UndoCommand(this, activeEditor)) }
        undoButton.setCommand(undo)
        shortcuts.onKeyPress("Ctrl+Z", undo)

    // Execute a command and check whether it has to be added to
    // the history.
    method executeCommand(command) is
        if (command.execute)
            history.push(command)

    // Take the most recent command from the history and run its
    // undo method. Note that we don't know the class of that
    // command. But we don't have to, since the command knows
    // how to undo its own action.
    method undo() is
        command = history.pop()
        if (command != null)
            command.undo()
